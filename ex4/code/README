Bonus QUESTIONS
---------------------
I've implemented a dynamic programming code as described at class.
My code is in the dynamic_seam.m file.
in my code, the cost matrix that is passed to this function is only the vertical strip of the region that
the current morphed image is intersecting with the current panorama image.
(plus one col each side to enable it go entirely 'behind an image') 
The matrix passed contains zeros at regions that non of the images exist, inf at positions that only one image exists,
and d = (I1-I2)^2 at positions that the images intersect.

In order to vectorize the inner loop for passing over all the cells in each row,
the code is creating a matrix of linear indices of the three possible neighbouring cells in the next row
and increments this matrix in each iteration.
Then it creates a chart of costs using a loop over the rows, and fills up a backtracking matrix that contains
the index each cell got its cost from.
Lastly it backtracks the backtrack matrix to find the seam ,and updates the mask accordingly.

In some input images the transformation is so that it's mathematically impossible for the dynamic method to find a 
solution. so the code holding the basic method is in the render panorama file so it is possible to use it instead.
(simply uncomment).
